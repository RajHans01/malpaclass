malaria parasite classification using CNN

Malaria is an infectious disease that causes over 400,000 deaths per year.Children aged under 5 years are the most vulnerable group affected by malaria; in 2018, they accounted for 67% (272 000) of all malaria deaths worldwide.
Malaria is an acute febrile illness. In a non-immune individual, symptoms usually appear 10–15 days after the infective mosquito bite. The first symptoms – fever, headache, and chills – may be mild and difficult to recognize as malaria. If not treated within 24 hours, P. falciparum malaria can progress to severe illness, often leading to death.
In 2018, nearly half of the world's population was at risk of malaria. Most malaria cases and deaths occur in sub-Saharan Africa. However, the WHO regions of South-East Asia, Eastern Mediterranean, Western Pacific, and the Americas are also at risk.

Pre-Proposed solution
In 2018, Rajaraman et al. published a paper entitled Pre-trained convolutional neural networks as feature extractors toward improved parasite detection in thin blood smear images.He worked on Neural nets and utilized six-pre trained convolutional Neural Networks.
But Feature extraction and subsequent training took a little over 24 hours and obtained an impressive 95.9% accuracy.
The problem here is the number of models being utilized — it’s inefficient
